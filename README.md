# Wall-Street-Journal-API-GUI
Use key words to find the title, author, and url within an API and display it onto a GUI and make it execeutable.

For this project I learned how to read through an API and parse through it and find data. As well as having a user search within the parsed data to see what the true output is needed to be. I did this as well as displaying all this data onto a GUI and making this executable. You will see in the code as well in the terminal when ran the learning objectives I did while doing this code.
